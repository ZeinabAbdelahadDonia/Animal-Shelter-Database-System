# Animal Shelter Database System

## Description

This project aims to design a robust database management system for animal shelters, focusing on efficiently organizing and managing data related to the shelter's animals, their medical histories, housing, and the adoption process. The database will store and retrieve critical information to support shelter operations and animal care encompassing comprehensive details about the shelter's facilities, the animals under care, their health records, adoption details, dietary needs, care plans, and information about the shelter's staff and volunteers.

## Files

Animal_Shelter_Database.sql: is a Microsoft SQL Server Query File containing the entire project including tables, triggers, views, and queries.

## Functionalities:

•  Capacity and Housing Management: Track the number of available and occupied cages within each unit, aiding in the efficient management of shelter capacity and animal placements.

•  Health and Medical Records Management: Maintain comprehensive health records for each animal, including disease history, medication details, and vaccination status, ensuring up-to-date health monitoring and care prioritization.

•  Adoption and Post-Adoption Services: Store detailed profiles of adopters and track adoption processes, including post-adoption follow-ups and check-ups to ensure the ongoing well-being of adopted animals.

•  Dietary Management: Document and manage the dietary requirements and history for each animal, facilitating tailored nutrition plans.

•  Care Plan Documentation: Record and manage care plans for animals, including rehabilitation and training details, and track the involvement of trainers and the progress of care plans.

•  Personnel and Volunteer Management: Store detailed information about shelter staff, volunteers, and trainers, including their roles, qualifications, and contributions to shelter activities.
